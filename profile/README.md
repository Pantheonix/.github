Welcome to **Pantheonix**, a work-in-progress educational platform which aims to be more than a mere competitive programming, interview training, blog or CMS based site...

We are aiming towards a holistical approach which is about to encompass all of these and maybe more:
- a rich competitive programming problems archive from various contests, other platforms or sources
- contests and ranking (similar to Codeforces approach: virtual contests, editorials, etc.) which can be easily integrated to enhance the student evaluation for specific courses at local profile universities/schools too
- CLI client for submitting solutions (maybe auth via SSH)
- blog posts and courses
- roadmaps for learning new concepts/programming languages similar to Exercism approach (maybe code review from special users/mentors too)
- support for tasks/checkers/interactive based problems and preview submissions on custom user provided tests (similar to LeetCode approach)
